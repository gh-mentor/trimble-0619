Given the following:

    Mask: 0b1010

    Array 1: [0b1010, 0b1100]
    Array 2: [0b0110, 0b0011]

How would you use prompt engineering to generate a transformation procedure that produces the following result?

    Array 1: [0b0010, 0b0110]
    Array 2: [0b1110, 0b1001]

The solution should be a function that takes the mask and the arrays as arguments.
