@workspace Recommend a table design to match the employee class hierarchy in the 'PayrollLibrary' project folder. Use T-SQL to create the tables.

@workspace show me T-SQL commands to create an 'Employees' table with a one-to-one relationship to an 'HourlyEmployees' table and a one-to-one relationship to a 'SalariedEmployees' table. The tables should model the classes: 'Employee' , 'SalariedEmployee', 'HourlyEmployee'

@workspace I need a technical report describing the 'PayrollLibrary' project. Include a an overall description, all classes, and License if one exists.

What are the key features of the project?
